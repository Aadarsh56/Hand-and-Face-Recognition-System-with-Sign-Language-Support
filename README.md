Hand and Face Recognition System
This project uses MediaPipe for hand and face detection and a machine learning model for hand gesture recognition. 
It also includes a text-to-speech (TTS) feature that speaks out recognized gestures using pyttsx3.

Features
Hand Gesture Recognition: Recognizes hand gestures and maps them to predefined labels.
Face Detection: Detects faces and ensures accurate differentiation between hands and faces.
Text-to-Speech: Converts recognized gestures into spoken words.
Real-Time Processing: Captures video frames and processes gestures and faces in real-time.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Required Libraries: Install these using the commands below:
bash
pip install mediapipe

How It Works
Gesture Recognition:

Captures landmarks of hand gestures using MediaPipe.
Uses a pre-trained machine learning model (model.p) to classify gestures.
Outputs the gesture label along with confidence percentage.
Face Detection:

Identifies faces in the video frame.
Ensures no misclassification of hand gestures as faces.
Text-to-Speech:

Converts recognized gestures into spoken words if the confidence is above 70%.
Avoids repeating the same word continuously.
Known Issues
Hand and face overlap can occasionally cause false positives.
The TTS feature may lag if gestures are rapidly changing.
Future Enhancements
Fine-tuning face and hand detection to improve accuracy.
Adding multi-language support for TTS.
Incorporating more gestures and facial expressions.
